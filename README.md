# businessDB
Full-stack, PHP7 + Angular(5+)


A simple application for (fictive) small business to keep track of your customers and the service you offer.

What is here right now:

-Database (MySQL) with 3 tables (customers, services and transactions) 

-a form to register customers and one to register services 

-a table where you can see all your customers, edit or delete them one by one, and a table to see, edit or delete your services


What is still work in progress:

-Form to register transactions (which service you sold to which customer) 

-and off course, as for customers and services, a table to see, edit or delete your transactions.



Technologies: PHP7 for the backend (plain PHP, no framework) and Angular(5+) for the frontend, with a minimal non-invasive routing animation to make it look smoother when navigate through components.

No security measure is implemented right now, no authentication, passwords, logins.
